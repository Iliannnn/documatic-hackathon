</p>

## Getting Started

If you don't have a React project yet, you can use create-react-app to get started, follow the instructions [here](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started/) to get started with create-react-app.

### Adding Min

Since this package includes the latest version of Min already, you don't need to install it separately.

=== "npm"

    ```sh
    npm install min-react
    ``` 

=== "yarn"

    ```sh
    yarn add min-react
    ``` 

=== "pnpm"

    ```sh
    pnpm add min-react
    ```

### Using Min

Import the Min components you want to use in your `src/App.js` file or your custom component file:

```js
import { Button } from 'min-react';
```
